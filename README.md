# Odin Recipies
This is where I will be able to practice my HTML skills to start setting up a website. Some things that I want to do here:

1. Set up the boilerplate in two ways
 * Type it manually
 * use `!`
2. Set appropriate title in <head>
3. Use the following things inside <body>
 * `<p>`
 * `<a href>`
 * `<img src>`
 * `<em>`
 * `<strong>`
 * `<ul>`
 * `<li>`
 * Absolute links
 * Relatiev links

 Make sure to put everything into folders already so I can learn to categorize it from the beginning.
